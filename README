Problem 1:
The key, plaintext, ciphertext (and iv), decrypted plaintext are all stored in files as hex encoded string.
First, an option of CBC mode (enter '1') or CTR mode (enter '2') is provided, then, an option of encryption (enter '1') or decryption (enter '2') is provided.

Problem 2:
The key, message, tag are all stored in files as hex encoded string.
First, an option of CBC mac (enter '1') or Hash-and-mac (enter '2') is provided, then the generated tag is saved in a file.
Then, an option of whether to valify a tag is provided, if you want to, the tag you want to valify must be saved in a file named 'tag.txt', and then hit '1' as yes.
